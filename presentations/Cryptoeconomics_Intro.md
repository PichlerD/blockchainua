## History

The design of secure 'digital cash' systems was first postulated by David
Chaum (1982) and the discourse continued (Chaum 1990; Tanaka, 1996;
Szabo, 1997; Dai, 1998; Van Hove 2000) until 2008, when Satoshi
Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin with a self-published paper (Nakamoto
2008) describing the blockchain ledger and inventing the first ‘cryptocurrency’. (Tarasiewicz, 2015)

##cryptoeconomics.


##cryptography<br>+<br>economics


##cryptoeconomics =
##cryptography, computer
##networks and game theory


###Cryptoeconomics focuses on the design
###and characterisation of protocols that
###govern the production, distribution, and
###consumption of goods and services in a
###decentralised digital economy.


##the study of economic
##interaction in an
##adversarial environment.


##Cryptoeconomic design
##focusses on creating
##systems with rules,
##incentives and penalties.


##creating mechanisms
##(rules) to produce an
##equilibrium outcome.


##Cryptoeconomic systems
##are decentralised and
##based on cryptography.


###“(I’ve been working on bitcoin’s design)
###since 2007. At some point I became
###convinced there was a way to do this
###without any trust required at all and
###couldn’t resist to keep thinking about it.”
###-- Satoshi Nakamoto


##Cryptoeconomics provides
##a security guarantee for a
##distributed system.


##Cryptoeconomics are often
##based on real-world economics
##(e.g. 51% attacks are very costly)


#Background


####In the 1970s, three different developments (the ciphers
####DES and RSA, and the Diffie-Hellman key exchange)
####came about, allowing individuals with modest
####computing resources to encrypt communication.


###Bitcoin and the
###Blockchain are a product
###of cryptoeconomics.


###Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)
###presented the first
###cryptoeconomic system.


###Solution to the “Byzantine
###Generals’ Problem” through
###economic incentives and
###basic cryptographic tools.


###finding consensus over
###the state of a system in
###an zero-trust
###environment.


###finding consensus over
###the state of a p2p system
###in an zero-trust
###environment.


###solving the problem of
###‘double spending’


###Nakamoto solved this by
###using a combination of
###economic incentives and
###basic cryptographic tools.


###(1) public - private key
###cryptography
###(2) proof-of-work with
###incentive


##cryptoeconomics today


###*Consensus protocols
###*Cryptoeconomic application
###designs (e.g. based on smart
###contracts)
###*State channels (judges)


###Example: bittorrent
###(p2p filesharing)
###lack of incentives to further
###seed a file after downloading.


###SIA (siacoin) as an
###example for incentivising
###the distributed storage
###through smart contracts
###and escrow.


###Example: Augur
###REP tokens are incentivising the
###creation of prediction markets,
###as well as ‘telling the truth’.


###Evaluating tokens:
###What is the cryptoeconomic
###mechanism of the token?


#wrap-up


###for the first time in history we are
###living in a time where we can
###design our experimental economic
###systems, and ultimately have them
###adopted and tested in real-time
###with a large number of
###participants.


###Newman & Tarasiewicz (2014)
