## History

>The design of secure 'digital cash' systems was first postulated by David Chaum (1982) and the discourse continued (Chaum 1990; Tanaka, 1996; Szabo, 1997; Dai, 1998; Van Hove 2000) until 2008, when Satoshi
Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin with a self-published paper (Nakamoto
2008) describing the blockchain ledger and inventing the first ‘cryptocurrency’. (Tarasiewicz, 2015)

## 2008

- Domain name "bitcoin.org" registered (Aug 15th)
- Bitcoin design paper published (Nov 31st)

## Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)<br>presented the first<br>cryptoeconomic system.

## Satoshi Nakamoto

>“I’ve been working on bitcoin’s design<br>since 2007. At some point I became<br>convinced there was a way to do this<br>without any trust required at all and<br>couldn’t resist to keep thinking about it.""

## Solution to the<br>“Byzantine Generals’ Problem”<br>through economic incentives<br>and basic cryptographic tools.



## cryptoeconomics defined.


## cryptography<br>+<br>economics


## cryptoeconomics =<br> cryptography, computer<br> networks and game theory


## Cryptoeconomics

focuses on the design <br>and characterisation of protocols that<br>govern the production, distribution, and<br>consumption of goods and services in a<br> decentralised digital economy.

<!-- this is one definition -->
## the study of economic<br>interaction in an<br>adversarial environment.

<!-- this is the aim -->
## creating mechanisms<br>(rules) to produce an<br>equilibrium outcome.


## Cryptoeconomics provides<br>a security guarantee for a<br>distributed system.<br>(e.g. 51% attacks are often economically unfeasable)


## cryptoeconomics today


* Consensus protocols
* Cryptoeconomic application designs (e.g. based on smart contracts)
* State channels (judges)


## Example: bittorrent (p2p filesharing)
lack of incentives to further seed a file after downloading.


## SIA (siacoin)
example for incentivising the distributed storage through smart contracts and escrow.


## Example: Augur
REP tokens are incentivising the creation of prediction markets, as well as ‘telling the truth’.


## Example: Conda.at (Crwdtoken)
Can an existing 20Million revenue startup gradually decentralize their business model, or will only new companies make the leap?


## Evaluating tokens:
What is the cryptoeconomic mechanism of the token?


## wrap-up


### for the first time in history we are<br>living in a time where we can<br>design our experimental economic<br>systems, and ultimately have them<br>adopted and tested in real-time<br>with a large number of<br>participants.
